        <h4>Temperature Conversion</h4>
        <p>
            This ruby program will prompt the user for a temperature
            in degrees Celsius and let the user know what the
            corresponding temperature is in Fahrenheit.

        <h4>Ordinal Challenge</h4>
        <p>
            This ruby program will convert a plain number
            to the ordinal of the number. So for example,
            if the user enters 2, it will display 2nd, if
            the user enters 3, it will display 3rd, etc.

        <h4>Foobar</h4>
        <p>
            This ruby program is an adaptation of a classic technical
            interview problem which displays sequences
            of the Foobar pattern.
